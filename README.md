# PCB_for_u360gts
This PCB is for u360gts, you can find the project here http://u360gts.implementax.com/index_en.html and here on github https://github.com/raul-ortega/u360gts/

I'm still working on this project, so changes might be made.
If you have no idea of where to make these PCbs, you can go to https://jlcpcb.com/  I get all my PCBs there. They also provide SMT services but you can do this by yourself since it is pretty easy to make.
